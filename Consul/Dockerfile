###################### Dockerfile for Consul - 1.20.5 ########################
#
# Consul is a tool for service discovery and configuration. Consul is distributed, highly available, and extremely scalable.
# Consul provides several key features like Service Discovery, Health Checking , Key/Value Storage , Multi-Datacenter
#
# To build this image, from the directory containing this Dockerfile
# (assuming that the file is named Dockerfile):
# docker build -t <image_name> .

# To simply run the resultant image, and provide a bash shell:
# docker run -it <image_name> /bin/bash
#
# Below is the command to use Consul:
# docker run --name <container_name> -it <image_name> consul <argument>
#
# Use below command to start the Consul agent in development mode :
# docker run --name consultest -d consul consul agent -dev
#
# Follow link to setup Consul cluster: https://www.consul.io/intro/getting-started/join.html
